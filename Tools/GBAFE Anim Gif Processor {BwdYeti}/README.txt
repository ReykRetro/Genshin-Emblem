Created by BwdYeti.
This tool is to be used in conjunction with FEBuilder's battle animation "Export All" function or when exporting only gifs. It fixes two problems:

1. Current functionality of FEBuilder causes the gifs to be created with improper timing (too fast). This rebuilds the gif to use the timings the animation would have ingame.

2. Current functionality of FEBuilder's "Export All" function creates two sets of identical frames. One with the named title and one with "_without_comment" appended to the end. This tool deletes the additional "_without_comment" frames and adjusts the references to them in .txt files.

To use:

Drag a folder containing FEBuilder exported gifs/pngs onto the .exe that this package came with.

***Do not separate "GBAFE Anim Gif Processor.exe" and "SimplePaletteQuantizer.dll" into different folders or gifs will not be processed***
